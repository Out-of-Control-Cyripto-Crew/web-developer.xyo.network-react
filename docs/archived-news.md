## A New SDK Guide

We are working on a new SDK Guide that will recommend which one to use depending on the application and/or level of integration with XYO Bound Witness protocol tools. 

These recommendations will emphasize higher-level SDKs first (the XYO SDK), and then core SDKs (Swift, Kotlin, Node), etc.

      Documentation for SDKs are available at the XYO Foundation GitHub
