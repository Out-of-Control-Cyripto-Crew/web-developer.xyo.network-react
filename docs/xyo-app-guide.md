## Installing the app 

- iOS
  - Visit the app store 

- Android

## Contexts

There are two primary contexts when you start up the app:
- Your device (android or iOS)
- The data ocean

## Your device context

Your device context centers around display of information relative to your device. This includes the proof of origin chain for your device and all devices near yours. 

## Controlling the four components

Your device context also contains four interfaces representing each component of the XYO network:

- Sentinel
- Bridge
- Archivist 
- Diviner

These interfaces indicate the current status of its component.

You can tap on a component to either pause or disconnect, here are the status toggles for each component interface:

- Sentinel (running or paused)
- Bridge (running or paused)
- Archivist (connected or disconnected)
- Diviner (connected or disconnected)

## Looking at the chain of bound witnesses

## Looking at nearby devices

## The data ocean context

The data ocean context is not related to your device therefore it does not have any component interfaces. What it does have is valuable information about the health of the network and overall bound witness amounts for the current origin chain along with how many total bound witness have been collected by our archivist.
